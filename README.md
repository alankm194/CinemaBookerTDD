# Cinema Seat Booker

a application that allows customers to book between 1 and 3 cinema tickets and the
application will assign them their seating number and record what seating number is 
assigned to which customer. 

## assumptions
when the last customer orders seats over the number of remaining seats left,
the cinema is considered full even though some seats are still are free

## Thoughts
The exercise was more difficult to test due to randomness of the customer orders
